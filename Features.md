## Main features of pyDataVis

- Input and output: 
  - Reading and automatic plotting of CSV and tabular text files 
  - Importing data from spreadsheet
  - Reading spectra in [JCAMP-DX format](http://www.jcamp-dx.org/protocols.html)
  - Reading Raman data file from the [RRUFF](https://rruff.info/) database.
  - Exporting data to CSV or to spreadsheet
  - Exporting to [Veusz](https://veusz.github.io/)

- Conversion:
  - Conversion of ".DAT" diffraction file format.
  - Simulation of a powder diffraction pattern from [CIF](https://www.iucr.org/resources/cif) file.
  - Plotting of a ".prf" file generated by [FullProf](https://www.ill.eu/sites/fullprof/index.html)
  - Change the shape of a data block
  - Transpose option which switches the rows and columns of a data block

There are many [free plotting sofware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Free_plotting_software) most of them far more powerful than *pyDataVis*. However, in terms of simplicity, it is hard to beat. Indeed it is very easy to use, just drag and drop your data file in *pyDataVis* window and immediately you are seeing the curves. For now, *pyDataVis* is limited to 2D plotting.

*pyDataVis* is an open source software written in [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)). It uses [PyQt](https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/) as graphic user interface (GUI) and [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) for plotting.
